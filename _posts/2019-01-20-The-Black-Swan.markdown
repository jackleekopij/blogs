*We're constantly told to 'not to fret the small things' but could this be doing us harm through a natural phenomena known as chaos?*
The Tipping Point, written by Malcom Gladwell is a fantastic exploration as to why under certain circumstances the smallest of differences can have disproportionately large effects. 



Check out the [jekyll-gh] GitHub repository for an application of chaos; an application of chaos to computer graphics. 
4 simple equations, recursively simulated from produces an image of a fern with similar random variation as to what's observed through out nature.
