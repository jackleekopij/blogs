Discuss how Bayesian inference is immensely important for making decisions; moreover how humans tend to forget base rates. 

Did Winston Churchill study probability in time away from being Prime Minister - articulating the famous quote "When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, madam?". And what does this statement tell us about decision making under the Bayesian perspective. 
Well, you might not realise it but like Churchill you apply the same probabilistic reasoning everyday without your knowing. Termed Bayesian Inference, among other names, it's the process of first observing an unfolding scenario, secondly contextualising the observations with your prior worldly experience and finally formulating a degree of belief about the scenario. 
Technical aspects of Bayesian inference followed by an exploration into how these methods of degree of belief differ from simple frequency counts for probability concluding on how to implement this line of reasoning into our everyday life. 

Arriving at a decision can by itself be a difficult process albeit selecting the truly optimal decision. 



Intro: 
	
Discuss what Bayesian inference is: 
	Prior (why is this important)
	Likelihood
	Posterior
	Thinking fast and slow example

Difference between posterior and likelihood (Bayes vs frequentist)
	The need to understand uncertainty
	If using MLE or MAP (single point) don't use frequentist methods. Will yield the same

How to use Bayesian thinking in everyday life.
	Never forget to use the base rate when making decisions.
	Resist the urge to think you are something special.
