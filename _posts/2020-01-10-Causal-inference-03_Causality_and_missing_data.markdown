Missing data is a reoccurring issue in any field aiming to utilise data to unlock insight. Phrases such "with more data there is potential to...", "a more complete data set would..." are consistently appended to analyses **akin to a 'get out of jail free card**. Albeit with the entire population of data results could simply be looked up from a table. Possession of such population (complete/census) data is very rarely if ever available. Therefor any data analysis would consistently be at risk of including aforementioned 'get out of jail free cards'. Not addressed in these **'sign offs'** is an explanation as to 'how the data is missing' and impact of such missing-ness. Here the types of missing data will be explored, methods to account for missing-ness concluding with discussion into how impacts on Causal Analysis.
