Paradox; a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition which when investigated may prove to be well founded or true.

To ascend the Causal Ladder and find ourselves on the second rung, doing, the idea of an **intervention** must be introduced. To take this step from the first rung of pure correlation one must first forgo the luxury of omitting hypotheses on the generation of the data; ideally one is involved in designing the collection of the data. Arriving at this second rung a new operator will be explored termed the "do-operator".

# Association based data;
  emphasis on collection processes are not considered;
  causes issues; not complete data sets -> over estimating benefits. Lawn example
  previously, learnt the joint distribution of the data
  joint distribution relies on the 'symmetry' of an equality sign

# Intervening; do-operator
  doing vs seeing; actively collecting data
  difference between conditioning (post) and do-operator (pre)
  can have the same joint distribution but vastly different do-based distributions
  equality sign is replaced with an 'arrow'. One variable listens to another.


# Construction of experiments; overcoming association
  one way to actively collect data is to design effective experiments
  randomised control trials; naturally known
  in above; the affected variable can be see as a pre collection design
