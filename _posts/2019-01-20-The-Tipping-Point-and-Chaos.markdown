*We're constantly told to 'not to fret the small things' but could thought process actually be doing us harm through a natural phenomena known as chaos?*

Small events and decisions are often discarded in our day to day lives, though phenomena termed chaos tells us these situations are exactly where our attention should be focused? 
Chaos has found fame in mainstream society under the popularised alias *the Butterfly Effect* which stress the importance of initial conditions, even those as insfignificant as the stroke of a Butterflys's wings. 
As interesting, what do these small changes tell us about epidemics and how do we as humans interact with chaos in our daily lives? Written with intentions to not only spike curiousity into one of nature's most beautiful complexities but to also provide guidance as to how YOU can tame chaos in your every day life!

(Introduce what initial conditions are, relevance to chaos ad
As previously alluded to, a system deemed chaotic will exhibit immeasurable sensitivity to its initial conditions, though what are initial conditions of a system? 
If a process is thought to evolve through time, the initial conditions of the systems can be thought of as the state of the system at the start of a process. 
A simple example of such sensitivity is the process of catching a bus. Under our initial conditions, our intention is to catch the first departing the local bus station when we arrive. The last 4 mornings you have arrived right on 06:45am, caught the 935 and arrived at work on time. 
Then on the fifth day you don't arrive at the stop until 06:31am, not a large difference, you stick to your rule and catch the next bus departing the stop, the 287. Fast-forward 5 minutes and this bus has gone in the complete opposite direction. You get off catch an taxi and arrive at work 30 minutes later. 

So what happend here and how is this related to chaos? Clearly our system (the bus routes??) were highly sensitive to a very small change in initial conditions (the time we arrive at the bus stop) resulting in substantially different outcome (the location the bus stops). 
High sensitivity to initial conditions summarises the effects of chaos and increasingly important how does chaos manifest itself into epidemics causing widespread effects from localised beginings? 

The Tipping Point, written by Malcom Gladwell is a fantastic exploration as to why under certain circumstances the smallest of differences can have disproportionately large effects within epidemics. 
# He articulates why those who cheat the payment system at a train station must be pushed to the full extent of the law and uses the mail system to illustrate *how smalll the world truly is*.
Success of an epidemic is distilled into three key factors the law of the few, stickiness factor and context. Importantly, just the right amount of cross-sectional change across these will cause and epidemic to take off like wild fire. 
Gladwell provides defines each as follows: 
	THE LAW OF THE FEW: is the 80/20 Principle (also known as Pareto Principle) where a select group (with a special set of social gift) are responsible for accelerating the propagation of an epidemic.  
	THE STICKINESS FACTOR: this analyses the content of the message of the epidemic and how memorable it is.
	POWER OF CONTEXT: makes reference to conditions and circumstances of time and place where the epidemic occurs. 
The above three factors all contribute to the proliferation of an epidemic and more importantly small tweaks to each will result in drastically different outcomes i.e. epidemics can be seen as a specific type of a chaotic system.

Defining a chaotic systems reliance on initial conditions and how chaos effects epidemics, how are chaotic systems are observed in everyday nature? Well, the a classical example is that of whether forecasting and the decrease in accuracy of forecasts as prediction time intervals increase.
You must have been affected by predictions in the past whereby 7 day weather forecasts consistently change however the 2 day forecasts are usually accurate. Again chaos is at play and causes these issues to arise. 
Although we posses all the physics to describe weather patterns, lack of ability to measure initial conditions precisely enough limits our forecasting window. To summarise error in initial measurements may not materialise over the 2 day look ahead but the 7th day the compounding effects on the error injects too much uncertainty into the forecast reducing precision power to near zero.

4 simple equations, recursively simulated from produces an image of a fern with similar random variation as to what's observed through out nature.
