# A review: 

## Chapter 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back
Lobsters, Jordan Peterson's synonymous animal. Immediatetly within this chapter Jordan makes references to crustacean providing a brief yet scientific summary of the hieararchy which lobsters live. 
Focus is placed upon the serotonin structure within the crustaceans and differeing amounts of this neurotransmitter present within these animals significant impacts on their relative status within a lobster ecosystem. 
In summary, lobsters with higher serotonin will act will have assume a higher position in said hieararchy while less dominant lobsters will maintain lower levels of serotonin. 

More interesting, than the absolute levels of this neurotransmitters is the relative changes of this chemical. Research (referenced by Jordan) shows that lobsters will transition through 3 different levels of engangement before they physically fight for terriority. 
1. the lobsters will dance around one another, showcasing their claws while secreting serum into the water from underneath their eyes. This serym provides information about the lobsters size, sex, health, and mood along with serotonin levels. 
2. if each lobster has not back down the progress to level 2; whipping each other with their atnenna
3. level 3; a wrestle ensues where each lobster tries to pin the other to the ground
4. if wrestling doesn't determine a clear winner they fight with their claws attacking each others' antenna, eyes and front legs. 

Regardless of whichever stage a lobster defeats his opponent in it will receive an increase in serotonin levels with the loser relising a decrease. It must be noted here that lobsters with higher serotonin levels are stronger, larger and have better postures relative to lower lobsters with lower levels. 
As a result a positive feedback system ensues; a lobster which wins a fight, increases his serotonin levels which inturn increases his chance of winning another fight which will then increase his serotonin levels, which again increases his chances of winning another fight and so forth.
From this the Matthew principle is both; he has everything more will be given and he who has nothing all will be taken. Such phenomenea is observed through many distributions throughout society; the wealthiest 1% of people own 50% of the world's wealth; the top 20% males get 80% of the females etc. 
The Pareto distribution is the name given to these phenomeneas. 

### Where to from here? 
Jordan is just starting to lay the foundations of his exploration into why just hierarchies in our modern societies are not only natural, a biproduct of millions of years of evolution, but why they are necessary for societies to function optimally.
