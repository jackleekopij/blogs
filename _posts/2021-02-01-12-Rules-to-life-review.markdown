# A review: 

## Chapter 1: Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back
Lobsters, Jordan Peterson's synonymous animal. Immediatetly within this chapter Jordan makes references to crustacean providing a brief yet scientific summary of the hieararchy which lobsters live. 
Focus is placed upon the serotonin structure within the crustaceans and differeing amounts of this neurotransmitter present within these animals significant impacts on their relative status within a lobster ecosystem. 
In summary, lobsters with higher serotonin will act will have assume a higher position in said hieararchy while less dominant lobsters will maintain lower levels of serotonin. 

More interesting, than the absolute levels of this neurotransmitters is the relative changes of this chemical. Research (referenced by Jordan) shows that lobsters will transition through 3 different levels of engangement before they physically fight for terriority. 
1. the lobsters will dance around one another, showcasing their claws while secreting serum into the water from underneath their eyes. This serym provides information about the lobsters size, sex, health, and mood along with serotonin levels. 
2. if each lobster has not back down the progress to level 2; whipping each other with their atnenna
3. level 3; a wrestle ensues where each lobster tries to pin the other to the ground
4. if wrestling doesn't determine a clear winner they fight with their claws attacking each others' antenna, eyes and front legs. 

Regardless of whichever stage a lobster defeats his opponent in it will receive an increase in serotonin levels with the loser relising a decrease. It must be noted here that lobsters with higher serotonin levels are stronger, larger and have better postures relative to lower lobsters with lower levels. 
As a result a positive feedback system ensues; a lobster which wins a fight, increases his serotonin levels which inturn increases his chance of winning another fight which will then increase his serotonin levels, which again increases his chances of winning another fight and so forth.
From this the Matthew principle is both; he has everything more will be given and he who has nothing all will be taken. Such phenomenea is observed through many distributions throughout society; the wealthiest 1% of people own 50% of the world's wealth; the top 20% males get 80% of the females etc. 
The Pareto distribution is the name given to these phenomeneas. 

### Where to from here? 
Jordan is just starting to lay the foundations of his exploration into why just hierarchies in our modern societies are not only natural, a biproduct of millions of years of evolution, but why they are necessary for societies to function optimally. 

## Chapter 2: Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible For Helping
Centred around self-loathing; Jordan turns the addage, 'treat others the way you would like to be treated yourself' on its head arguing 'you should treat yourself as the way you would treat somebody you loved'. He initiates this discussions with statistics on rates of prescription medication actually being correctly when we're responsible for ourselves being dramatically low, however, when we are responsible for another being or pet taking prescription medication rates successful administration is almost gauranteed. Discussions are provided to support a notion that children and pets have an auroa of innocence that us as first person controllers of our own lives could not possible expect to deserve. Jordan argues the opposite and suggest that we, ourselves, are exactly the people who deserve to be helped first.

When you and I take good care of ourselves, we make sure we are the strong one in the relationship. Without taking care of ourselves (both physically and mentally) the tyrant-slave relationship forms. However, when we do take care of ourselves we stand as a good role model for our own dignity and our own wellbeing. And this energy carries on towards other people. The world is better this way. Because chaos and suffering is the status quo.

### In our every day lives
- Integrity; we must as individuals take care of ourselves while keeping ourselves to account; a healthy trade-off/balance between sacrificing the present for the future. Try to tell the truth to others but NEVER lie to yourself!

## Chapter 3: Make Friends With People Who Want The Best For You
It is true we are the sum product of the 5 people we spend the most time with in our lives. As such it becomes a moral obligation to not only carefully select these 5 people but determine why these particular people are included in our lives. 

Throughout the chapter Jordan explores this why and questions the reader to understand their true rationales for the friendships they hold. The chapter begin with a story of a boy, Chris, who Jordan grow up with in his younger years. Detailed are the opportunities life presented both Chris and Jordan himself. With similar opportunities presented both Chris and Jordan ended up taking vastly different trajectories with Jordan attributing a significant determinant being the crowds each decided to assosciate with. He rationalised Chris' decision to stay in his friendship circle an action of comfort; Chris was not aiming high enough, he was not aiming at all. He used the group around him to satisfy his own ego knowing that he could achieve a feeling of satisfaction if others around him were doing worse than him. 

Further, Peterson asks the reader to reflect on their current friendships with objectivity. He presents a compelling argument to the reader that if a friendship is detrimental to an individuals growth in desired areas then one has no moral obligation to maintain/continue friendship "Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement. You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a worse place.‚Äù In undertaking such cost-benefit analysis Peterson suggests that the reader shouldn't "merely assume that said friend in question is a noble victim of unjust circumstances and exploitation", arguing that friendships maintained long past expiration date are done so out of compassion for victim.

### In our every day lives
Always aim to gainer friendships with people of quality; people who not only have strengths and knowledge in areas you would like to grow but friends who will also celebrate success once you achieve your goal.
